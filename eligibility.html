                <h1>When a child/parent is eligibile to adopt?</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>As per the guidelines of the Central Government of India, any orphan, abandoned (desserted or
                        unaccompanied by the legal parents or children) or surrendered (has been relinquished because of
                        physical, social and emotional factors beyond the control of the family) child declared legally
                        free for adoption by the child welfare committee is eligible for adoption.</li>
                    <li>In order to be adopted, a child or parent needs to be “legally free”. On receipt of an abandoned
                        child/parent, the District Child Protection Unit puts up an alert with the child’s/parent's
                        photograph and details in state-wide newspapers and requests the local police to trace the
                        parents or children. The child or parent is considered legally free for adoption only after the
                        police have given a report stating that the parents of the child or the children of the parents
                        are non-traceable.</li>
