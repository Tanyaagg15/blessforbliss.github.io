            <h3>What is Adoption?</h3>
            <p>Children adoption is very popular around the world but nowdays parents adoption is also gaining equal
              importance.</p>
            <p>
              The permanent legal transfer of all parental rights from one person to another person or couple is called
              <i><b>Adoption</b></i>. There is no difference between the rights of adoptive parentsor children and the
              biological parents or children and an adopted childrenor parents have all of the social, legal, emotional and
              kinship benefits of biological children or parents.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Adoption provides help to the hopeful parents or children who are not able to have children or parents
                otherwise.</li>
              <li>It is popoular option for same-sex people, individual parents or children who do not have children or
                parents.</li>
              <li> It provides love,care, happiness to those parents and children who are abandoned by their children and
                parents.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The best adoptions are those where prospective adoptive parents or children are able to move beyond their
              personal desires and have the interests of the adopted child or parent in mind.
