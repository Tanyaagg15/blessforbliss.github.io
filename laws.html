                <h3>Laws of Adoption</h3>
                <p>Laws of adoption helps in adopting the children or parents voluntarily as one's own in compliance
                    with formal legal procedures. Even though adoption is an age old practice, adoption laws have come
                    into existence when England passed the first law in 1926.</p>
                <p>A legal framework was established so as to protect the rights of the adopted child or parent.</p>
                <p>In India, adoption falls under the ambit of personal laws. Diverse religions are practiced in our
                    country due to which many laws and acts come into existence. </p>

                <h1>Adoption under English Law</h1>
                <p>The English Law started recognizing adoption during latter half of nineteenth century. This laws
                    states that adopted child or parent, for all intent and purposes become like a natural child or
                    parent and the relationship between the natural family abandoned.</p>

                <h1>Hindu Law and Adoption</h1>
                <p>Hindu law is the only law which addresses an adopted people as being compeer to a natural child or
                    parent because of the belief that a son was indispensable for spiritual as well as material welfare
                    of the family. </p>

                <p>Earlier, Hindu law allowed only male to be adopted. Under Hindu law, female could not be adopted.
                    Moreover, only the male had a right to adopt and the dissent of his wife was immaterial.</p>

                <p>With the passage of time, such restrictions have changed. Gender biases have reduced to a great
                    extent in todayâ€™s modern society. At present, under modern Hindu law, every Hindu male or female has
                    the capacity to make an adoption provided he or she has attained majority and are of sound mind.
                    Mostly, all of these laws, rules and regulations have been itemized in the Hindu Adoptions and
                    Maintenance Act of 1956.</p>
