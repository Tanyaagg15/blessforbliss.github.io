                <h3>Process for Adoption</h3>
                <p>The adoption process in India is governed by multiple laws, and adherence to the same is overseen by
                    the Central Adoption Resource Authority. </p>
                <p>The procedure for adoption of a child in India can be understood in the following steps:</p>
                <p><b><u>Step 1 – Registration</u></b></p>
                <p>Prospective adoptive parents need to get registered with an authorized agency. Recognised Indian
                    Placement Agencies (RIPA) and Special Adoption Agency (SPA) are the agencies which are allowed to
                    make such registrations in India. In addition, the prospective adoptive parents or children can
                    visit the Adoption Coordination Agency in their area where the social worker will explain the
                    process and take you through the formalities, paperwork and general preparation required for
                    registration.</p>
                <p><b><u>Step 2 – Home Study and Counselling</u></b></p>
                <p>A social worker for the registration agency will make a visit to the home of the prospective adoptive
                    parent or child in order to do a home study. The agency might also need the parents to attend
                    counselling sessions to understand prospective parents’ motivation, preparation, strengths and
                    weaknesses. As per CARA regulation, the home study must be completed within three months from the
                    registration date.The conclusion from the home study and counselling sessions is then reported to
                    the honourable court.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="content-left">
                <p><b><u>Step 3 – Referral of the Child or Parent</u></b></p>
                <p>The agency shall intimate the interested couple, child whenever there is a child or parent ready for
                    adoption. The agency will share medical reports, physical examination reports and other relevant
                    information with the couple and allow them to spend time with the child once they are comfortable
                    with the details.</p>
                <p><b><u> Step 4 – Acceptance of the Child or Parent</u></b></p>
                <p>Once the parents or children are comfortable with a child or parent, they will have to sign a few
                    documents pertaining to the acceptance of the child or parent.</p>
                <p><b><u>Step 5 – Filing of Petition</u></b></p>
                <p>All necessary documents are submitted to a lawyer who prepares a petition to be presented to the
                    court. Once the petition is ready, the adoptive parents or children will have to visit the court and
                    sign the petition in front of the court officer.</p>
                <p><b><u>Step 6 – Pre-Adoption Foster Care</u></b></p>
                <p>Once the petition is signed in the court, the adoptive parents or children can take the child or
                    parent to a pre-adoption foster care centre and understand the habits of the child or parent from
                    the nursing staff before taking the child home.</p>

            <div class="contentl-right">

                <p><b><u>Step 7 – Court Hearing</u></b></p>
                <p>The parents or children have to attend a court hearing along with the child or parent. The hearing is
                    held in a closed room with a judge. The judge may ask a few questions and mention the amount that
                    needs to be invested in the child’s or parent's name.</p>
                <p><b><u>Step 8 – Court Order</u></b></p>
                <p>Once the receipt of investment made is shown, the judge shall pass the adoption orders.</p>
                <p><b><u>Step 9 – Follow Up</u></b></p>
                <p>Post-completion of the adoption, the agency must submit follow-up reports to the court on the child’s
                    or parent's well-being. This may continue for 1-2 years.</p>
